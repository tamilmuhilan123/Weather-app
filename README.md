🌦️ Weather App

Hey there! 👋
This is a simple and modern **React.js Weather App** I built to show real-time weather updates for any city.
It uses the **WeatherAPI** to fetch accurate weather data and gives you a quick view of the **current weather, 7-day forecast, and sunrise/sunset times** — all in one clean interface.

🚀 Features

✨ **Real-Time Weather Data** – Get instant updates for any city in the world.
☀️ **7-Day Forecast** – Check the weather for the upcoming week.
🌇 **Sunrise & Sunset Info** – See the exact time the sun rises and sets each day.
🌧️ **Dynamic Weather Icons** – The icons change automatically based on real conditions.
🕵️‍♂️ **Recent City History** – Quickly revisit the last cities you searched.
📱 **Fully Responsive** – Works perfectly on desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.

🛠️ Tech Stack
